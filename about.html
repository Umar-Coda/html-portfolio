    <h1>Hello again, I'm Umar Codabaccus</h1>

    I grew up in Mauritius and still living there. I went to University of Mauritius to get Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
    It's been a year since I have been realising people's ideas into apps, and I have been successfull at that.

    My communication skills are top-notch, I am a great guy to talk to and if you have to contact me you know where to find me
